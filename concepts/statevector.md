## The Quantum Statevector

The Quantum statevector is a vector of complex numbers that describes the state of our Quantum Computer at a given point in computation. It is a probability distribution that represents the likelihood of the qubits collapsing into those states.

The size of the statevector is `2^n`, where `n` is the number of qubits in our system.
