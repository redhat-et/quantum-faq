# Frequently Asked Questions

This file contains some commonly asked questions pertaining to Quantum Computing. 
If you have a question that you can't find in here, feel free to create an issue for it and we'll add it shortly.


### What is Quantum Computing?

> Quantum Computing is a paradigm in computational theory which makes use of quantum mechanical 
> properties in order to solve *certain* problems more efficiently in comparison to existing classical methods. 

We can also define Quantum Computing without making any comparison to classical computing: 
> Quantum Computing is a computational paradigm which evaluates computational problems by exploiting
> quantum-mechanical properties in order to process states simultaneously and filtering out the solutions.


### Who can use Quantum Computing?

Anyone with access to a computer can get started with Quantum Computing, and I don't mean a quantum computer.
Quantum Simulators are programs that can be used to simulate quantum systems, and are implemented with
various quantum computing frameworks.


### How can I get started with Quantum Computing?

Great question! See [`RESOURCES.md`](./RESOURCES.md) for a list of resources to get you started.
